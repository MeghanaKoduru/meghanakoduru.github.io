How is the survey structured?\nThis survey is broken down into multiple sections. It starts with a welcome message and then moves into a single set for all the questions. The questions are mixed and could be re-arranged better to stick to one theme for a set of questions. A section for each type of question would make the navigation better. Also, the choices for the multiple-choice are not listed in uniform fashion, either horizontally or vertically. The aesthetics of the survey can be better.\nb. What is the questionnaire composed of?\nThis questionnaire is a part of pre-market survey to measure interest in a software that helps moderate content on a subscriber’s account. The survey is trying to find the price point for such a software and is also trying to capture behavior of its prospective customers like online purchases, quantity of content consumed, type of hardware to access content.\nc. How are the questions ordered?\nThe first section mainly asks about the kind of content the audience prefers. Secondly, the questions are focused on the software that the surveyor is trying to bring to the market. The survey ends with demographic demographic questions.\n\nWhat can be done to improve respondent’s experience.\nThe listing of Multiple-choice questions can be standardized. Questions 2,5, and 6 are not mobile friendly. The matrix table may be a difficult option to get responses can be replaced by a simpler set of multiple-choice questions.\nFurther Assignment: Importing a survey from Qualtrics library.\nWhat is the difference between this block and previous instrument?\nThe main difference is that the Diversity and Inclusiveness survey is mostly about gender and inclusiveness in terms of their role as well as the workplace culture. The two questions about income and education are pure demographic questions to capture social identifiers of the respondent.\nhttps://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cBgqvTkf9tbWA2W"

Cite some examples.\nhttps://simplified.com/blog/ai-text-to-image/generative-art\nGenerative art is a type of art that is created using algorithms and other process that result in unique, intricate, and beautiful works of art. Unlike traditional art, which is created by a single artist, generative art is created by computer using complex code or an algorithm.\nMichael Hansmeyer is a Swiss architect best known for using generative art in architecture. Hansmeyer’s work focuses on including algorithms to create complex, three dimensional shapes that are impossible to achieve using traditional methods of fabrication. His famous and remarkable design like white tower tells us just how vast and unexplored the world of art truly is. The White Tower’s key design element is a set of 104 3D- printed columns. These support the various levels of the building and also form the tower’s facade. The subdivided columns are purely algorithmic forms. They are impossible to draw using conventional means - whether by pen or mouse - as they have too much detail and differentiation.\n\nRun Fall.R (on teams)\n\na. Give your own colors\nb.

(book/article/ website)\nThis figure is titled “Graph of Interaction Effect between Sex and Borderline Traits Predicting Status Offenses”. Interactions effects plots are used to visualize how the effect of an variable change according to the value of another variable. According to McGill and Stefurak (2021), the female participants “exhibited higher rates of borderline traits, trauma symptoms and status offenses, hypothesized, the sex by offending interaction suggests that symptoms are unique predictors of male’s status offending, rather than females”. This can be clearly seen by the positive of the red line for male inn relation to borderline traits and status offenses. On the other hand, the negative slope of the green line for the female offenders in relation to borderline traits and status offenders indicates these symptoms are not unique predictor’s of female’s status offending. Although the chart does clearly and evidently show the opposite effects sex has on relationship between borderline traits and status offending, there are some important components of this chart that are missing. For example, there is no reference for the interpreter to understand what the measurements are for the x and y axes. Furthermore, there is no indication as to the significance of x and y axis units or increments. Also, the chart doesn’t have the figure description attached to it in the article, so the reader doesn’t have anything to refer to while interpreting the chart. For this reason, it’s difficult for the reader to understand the importance of the figure alone without having to refer to the discussion and conclusion of the article."
